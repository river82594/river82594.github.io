  <h1>All About Otters</h1>
  
  <h2>Characteristics:</h2>
  
  <p>Webbed feet and powerful tails, which act like rudders, make otters strong swimmers. Their nostrils and ears close to keep water out, and waterproof fur keeps them warm. They must carefully groom their fur and furry undercoat to keep them clean and sealed off to water, because they’re not covered in a fatty layer like other seagoing creatures. Otters have the densest fur of any animal—as many as a million hairs per square inch in places.</p>
  
  <h2>Amazing Behavior:</h2>

    <a href ="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/n/north-american-river-otter/">River otters</a>

   are expert hunters that eat fish, crustaceans, and other critters. Sea otters have an ingenious method to open shellfish. A sea otter will float on its back, place a rock on its chest, then smash the mollusk down on it until it breaks open.</p>
  <p>When it’s time to nap, sea otters entangle themselves in kelp so they don’t float away. They also sometimes intertwine their feet with another sea otter, so that they stay together.</p>
  <p>River otters are especially playful, gamboling on land and splashing into rivers and streams. They learn to swim when they are about two months old, when their mother pushes them into the water.</p>
